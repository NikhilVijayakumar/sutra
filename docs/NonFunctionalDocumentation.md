# Project Sutra: Non-Functional Documentation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** July 30, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for Project Sutra. These requirements specify the quality attributes and operational characteristics of the system, ensuring it is not only functional but also efficient, reliable, secure, and easy to maintain.

## 2. Performance

Performance requirements address the system's responsiveness and resource consumption during its key operations.

* **Analysis Time:** The time required to analyze a codebase will be directly proportional to the size and complexity of the project. The system should be optimized to perform analysis on a medium-sized project (e.g., 50,000 lines of code) in a reasonable timeframe, without excessive delays.
* **Resource Consumption:** The application should be designed to run on a standard developer machine without consuming an unreasonable amount of CPU or memory. Memory usage should be managed efficiently, especially when handling large files.
* **API Latency:** The system relies on external LLM APIs. It must be resilient to network latency and include reasonable timeouts for API calls to prevent the application from hanging indefinitely.

## 3. Reliability & Availability

Reliability focuses on the system's ability to perform its functions consistently and recover from failures.

* **Error Handling:** The system must implement robust error handling. It should gracefully manage common failures, such as invalid file paths in the configuration, missing API keys, network errors, or malformed source code files, providing clear and actionable error messages to the user.
* **Statelessness:** The application is designed to be completely stateless. It does not maintain any session data or history between runs. This design inherently increases reliability, as each execution is independent and not affected by the outcome of previous runs.
* **Availability:** The system's availability is primarily dependent on the availability of the external LLM API it is configured to use (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, or a local model). The core application itself is available whenever the user can run it on their machine.

## 4. Usability & Configurability

Usability concerns the ease with which a user can configure and operate the system.

* **Configuration:** The system must be easy to configure. All user-specific settings, such as file paths and project rules, will be managed through a single, well-documented YAML configuration file. Sensitive information like API keys will be handled separately via a `.env` file.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The application will be run from the command line. The interface should be simple, with clear commands to initiate different workflows (e.g., documentation generation, code audit).
* **Output Clarity:** All generated outputs (documentation and reports) must be clear, well-formatted, and easy to understand. Error messages and logs should be informative enough for a user to diagnose and resolve issues without needing to inspect the source code.

## 5. Security

Security requirements address the protection of user data and system integrity.

* **Data Privacy:** The application processes source code locally. No source code or proprietary information should be transmitted to any third party, except for the necessary interactions with the configured LLM API. Users should be aware of the data policies of their chosen LLM provider.
* **Secret Management:** All sensitive data, particularly API keys, must be managed securely through environment variables (`.env` file) and should never be hardcoded in the source code or checked into version control.
* **Dependency Security:** The project must regularly audit its third-party dependencies (via tools like `pip-audit`) to identify and mitigate known security vulnerabilities.

## 6. Maintainability & Extensibility

Maintainability refers to the ease with which the system can be modified, updated, and extended.

* **Modular Architecture:** The system is built on a clean, domain-driven architecture. This separation of concerns (core logic, infrastructure, application layer) makes it easy to modify one part of the system without impacting others.
* **Code Quality:** The codebase must adhere to high standards of quality, enforced by tools like `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, and `mypy`. This ensures the code is readable, consistent, and easy for new developers to understand.
* **Test Coverage:** The project must have a comprehensive test suite (`pytest`) with high code coverage. This allows developers to make changes with confidence, knowing that the test suite will catch regressions.
* **Extensibility:** The agent and crew-based design allows for easy extension. New capabilities can be added by creating new, specialized crews without requiring significant changes to the existing application logic.
